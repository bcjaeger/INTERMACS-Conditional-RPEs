# INTERMACS

**What is it?**

- The INTEragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support.

- Details...

- More details!

--

**What questions can it answer?**

- *Traditional:* Can historical patient data predict new patient outcomes?

- *Novel:* Can <font color="red">follow-up data</font> improve outcome prediction?

# Patient Perspective

As patient's live with mechanically assisted circulatory support,

- they engage with a lot of uncertainty.

# Patient Perspective

As patient's live with mechanically assisted circulatory support,

- they want answers to important questions.

# Patient Perspective

As patient's live with mechanically assisted circulatory support,

- they ask questions that current risk prediction tools can't answer! 

---

# Why We Care About Follow-up

**Things change after surgery**

- adverse events happen (e.g., stroke, infection)

- biomarkers change (e.g., bilirubin)

--

**Smarter care**

- Patient care can be supported by monitoring risk for events (death, stroke, infection, malfunction).

- Patients can receive interventions that are most likely to benefit them.

---

# Our Goals

**Create**

- INTERMACS wasn't designed for this analysis

- Heavy data processing!

--

**Analyze**

- Follow-up data haven't been used for risk prediction yet

- A number of methods can be used - which works best?

--

**Communicate**

- What can be gained in terms of risk prediction?

- What variables are driving the changes in risk?

- Explaining predictions at a patient-specific level.

# Gold Standard: The Expert's Model

layout: true

# Testing the Expert
---

**What we did**

- Made a risk prediction equation using the expert's selection of variables

- Fit a Cox proportional hazard model using these variables at week 0, week 1, and week 4, separately.

**How we tested**

- Each model was used to predict risk for mortality in the `testing` data. 

- Predictions were evaluated by computing a C-statistic

- C-statistic $\approx$ probability that the model predicts higher risk for a patient who will die versus one who will not (at or before a specific time).

# Gradient boosting with R

**What we used:** 

`xgboost`, an R package for (extreme) boosting

--

**What we did**

- Internally tested ~ 6,000 different tuning parameters.

- 100-fold cross-validation on the training data.

- Over 600,000 models fitted and evaluated (*thanks, PMP!*)

--

**What we got**

- One very prognostic model.

- A bunch of prognostic variables we didn't know about.

- (side project) the `xgboost.surv` R package: software to make survival analyses with `xgboost` more user-friendly! ([Learn more here](https://bcjaeger.github.io/xgboost.surv/))

# How prognostic, you ask?

# Expert model

```{r}
readr::read_rds('figs/dead_cph_cstats.rds')
```

---

# Boosted model

```{r}
readr::read_rds('figs/dead_xgb_cstats.rds')
```

# Conclusions

We have much more work to do!

- Testing other modeling algorithms (e.g., random forest)

- Variable importance

- Variable effects

- Using Shapley values to 

    + explain predictions.
    
    + identify patient clusters
